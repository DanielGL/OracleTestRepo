# OracleTestRepo
This is a test repository for our github workshop.

Any file can use markdown formats if they have a .md extension.

Try editing files A, B, and/or C and going through the typical workflow.

You can practice using the markdown format here.

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
  * Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
  1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item. 
    * Unordered list can use asterisks
    - Or minuses
    + Or pluses
